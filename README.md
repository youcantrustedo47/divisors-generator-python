Wanna find all the divisors of an odd number? You're in the right place
I've creaqted this simple program in order to be able to calculate all the possible divisors of the oddest number on earth.
There are a bunch of sites online but none of them is focused only on the divisors, so enjoy!
(If you're a web developer hmu)
